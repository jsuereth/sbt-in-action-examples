# sbt in Action Example code
This project contains the example code for sbt in Action.   The code takes the form of a serious of sbt builds for a sophisticated website called preowned-kittens.com that handles the resale of pet kittens.    The website attempts to find ideal owners by matching buyer survey questions to know statistics of happy pet owners, and behavior characteristics of the kittens.

The project is split into directories by chapter, and then optionally by section.    The final build is located under a directory called `final` for those who wish to see/use the completed product.

While the website and analysis code itself is rather simplistic and silly, the sbt build should be self-explantory (to those who know sbt) and well documented.

If you're following along in the book, feel free to run your `sbt` directly against the chapter / section directory you're currently reading, and try thing sout.
